DALBERG DATA INSIGHTS

Karamoja is the most food-insecure region of Uganda, primarily due to low crop productivity which is exacerbated by
intense droughts, pest infestations and disease outbreaks. These challenges significantly impact crop production in
area particurarly for the region's stable foods; maize and sorghum. 

Several NGOs operate in Karamoja providing technical support as well as farm inputs to farmers being faced by 
extremely low crop yields. However, these NGOs lack a clear perspective of the region and often rely on local 
sources to plan their interventions effectively. This gap in data makes it difficult for the NGOs to identify 
regions that require their support. Because of this, Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) have been enaged in order to 
develop a new food security monitoring tool that the NGOs will use to make informed decisions. This has been made 
possible by the use of satellite imagery to measure crop yileds for sorghum and maize.

The Insight derived will be used by the NGOs to make informed decisions on which regions require more help and 
support in order to curb the food insecurity crisis in these areas.
